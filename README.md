I am passionate about combining machine learning algorithms with real big data. My undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at the U of I have given me confidence in several programing languages (including Python, R, and C++) and data system infrastructures (such as distributed computing). In my undergraduate internship at the NCSA, I configured virtual machines and prepared for data analysis by building, testing, and extracting data from a PostgreSQL database on that machine. Then, during my PhD studies, my research centered on applying robust machine learning algorithms to the sequential quickest change detection problem, a classical problem in statistics, meanwhile obtaining theoretical guarantees. In my graduate internship at Corteva, I cleaned and explored the corn biogenetecs data, searched for candidate regression models with scikit-learn, and optimized two models (SVR and XGBoost) by sophisticated hyperparameter tuning. I hope to connect all these practical and theoretical skills with real big data in my future career, and I am looking for full Data Scientist positions starting from Summer 2023.
